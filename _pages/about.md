Hi!üëãüèº

I am a fifth-year PhD student in the [Department of Linguistics](https://ling.rutgers.edu) at Rutgers University. I am broadly interested in how language is structured and how structural properties interact with meaning. My research interests span syntax, semantics and their interface, with a particular focus on agreement, anaphora and demonstratives. I investigate linguistic phenomena through both theoretical analysis and experimental methods. 

News
======
[Dorothy Ahn](https://dorothyahn.com) and I will present on *kind-denoting demonstratives* at [LingDem](https://vicom.info/sub30-lingdem/), a special session of **SuB 2025** [abstract](/files/2025-SuB30-Zhang-Ahn.pdf)

Research
======

Agreement and reference 
------
I am currently working on my dissertation on agreement, examining how referentiality influences agreement patterns in complex nominals and quantified phrases.

Long-distance binding of Mandarin reflexives in fragment answers 
------
I observe that the complex reflexive *taziji* in Mandarin Chinese is more likely to take a non-local antecedent in fragment answers than in full sentential structures. Based on novel arguments from the blocking effect on *ziji* and preposition matching, I argue that fragment answers in Mandarin are derived from deletion of full syntactic structures. I propose that *taziji* moves from the embedded clause to the left periphery, followed by ellipsis of the remaining TP to create a long-distance binding in fragments.

I am currently working on an experiment with Shannon Bryant to investigate this non-local dependency and provide further empirical support for the analysis.
  
Kind-referring demonstratives 
------
I argue that demonstratives can form kind-denoting expressions and support this claim with novel evidence from Xi‚Äôanese demonstratives and their English counterparts. I also provide a formal analysis of how this kind-based interpretation is derived, incorporating a slight modification to the canonical semantics of demonstratives.
