## Research 

### Long-distance dependency of reflexives in Mandarin fragment answers
I argue that fragment answers in Mandarin are derived from deletion of full syntactic structures. I propose that *taziji* moves from the embedded clause to the left periphery, followed by ellipsis of the remaining TP to create a long-distance binding in fragments.

### More than *that*: demonstratives denoting kinds
The paper focuses on demonstratives in a non-canonical structure in Xi’anese to investigate their ability to denote kinds. I argue that demonstratives can form kind expressions and also provide a formal analysis of how this kind-based reading is derived. By examining the semantics of a non-canonical structure in Xi’anese, I show that it differs from a standard definite description. Although its surface word order appears unattested, I propose that it can emerge from distinct underlying constructions or semantics, such as a partitive structure or a kind-denoting expression.
